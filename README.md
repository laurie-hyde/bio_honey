Computer Graphics Project - Final Year

Bio Honey was a final year project for a realtime computer graphics paper at Victoria University Wellington. 
The focus on my part was to create a realtime scalable physics simulation using spheres with 3D elastic collisions and attraction methods. Shading files and implementation in the primary 'application' files were done primarily by Zoe Richards, my project partner. However, Oren Nayar, Cook Torrance, and UV mapping shaders/texture files were my own.

The project uses OpenGL and C++ to give the output.

DISCLAIMER: This project was done as a learning experiment with the Victoria University Wellington ECS and Computer graphics department, and as such, some code has been provided by the department.
